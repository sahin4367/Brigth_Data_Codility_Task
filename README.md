# Bright Data Coding Task - JavaScript Solution

This repository contains my solution for the Bright Data coding task, originally provided via Codility.  
The task focuses on working with arrays and maps to perform specific operations efficiently.

---

## ðŸš€ **Task Overview**
The goal of the task was to:
- Implement a function that processes a given set of data.
- Use efficient JavaScript methods and data structures (such as `Map`, `.has()`, and `.get()`).
- Return the correct output based on the given input.

---

## ðŸ›  **Technologies Used**
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (for running the solution locally)

---

## ðŸ“‚ **Project Structure**

## â–¶ **How to Run**
Follow these steps to execute the code:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahin4367/Brigth_Data_Codility_Task

Run the JavaScript file - node main.js
âœ… Key Methods Used

Map â€“ For storing key-value pairs efficiently.

.has(key) â€“ Checks if a key exists in the map.

.get(key) â€“ Retrieves the value associated with a specific key.
// Example input
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1];
const result = solution(arr);
console.log(result);

ðŸ“œ About This Repository

This solution was implemented as part of a technical assessment for Bright Data.
The code focuses on clarity, efficiency, and best practices.
